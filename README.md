# veloton

When you run this autohotkey script on your PC, it will map a Bluetooth media button to the Veloton controls. 

Make sure autohotkey is installed on your PC. 

Make sure you have a media button connected to your PC's Bluetooth. 

You can save this script in any folder. I just have it saved on my desktop. 

To run it the script, just double click on it and it will load.
